### USE gh branch in my Github to see latest works. Thanks

## my db.json file is in the folder "backend'. it will take like 50sec. for dbjson to fetch fully.

## MY HTML CODE:

Creating an website App that parents can use to searcch for Tutors.
willing Tutors can register/signUp. The website uses a db.json to store tutors information.

The App has a tutor signup form, a search by filter menu and other elements under 'construction'
e.g parent's create account, login and a button for showing upcoming kids events. will develope their functionality in future.

## MY STYLE.JS CODE.

My javascript code triggers events in the App as follows:

-when user click 'Become a Tutor and Earn' button. A signUp form pops-up allowing
user to put his/her information.

-by clicking the submit button, details are stored in a db.json file.
An alert pops up to inform user if details has been submitted sucssesfully.

-Details are transffered to the display div, parents can then search by filter for the signed up tutors by selecting on the subject they want and clicking on the search button.

-search button display a list of pictures of the tutors with their informatiion and contact. Parents can now use the contact infor to call their
prefered candidate.

-json server must be live/run to ensure data is fetched into the App for display.
also form will only submit details when server is running.
